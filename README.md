# To test the basic functionality of the package, launch test.bat on a windows machine.

# To test out more functionality, launch Server and Client on two different terminals. You can also launch multiple clients on the same machine. The server will send a message to all clients when a new client connects. The clients will send a message to the server when they connect. The server will also send a message to all clients when a client disconnects.

# To manually test out the functionality, compile the Server and Client classes and run them on two different terminals. You can then send messages to the server and other clients using the client terminal.
